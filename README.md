# TimeLock dApp

This is a simple dApp that allows you to lock an encrypted message on-chain for a certain amount of time. 
The dApp is built using the [Next.js Framework](https://nextjs.org/) & [Thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/).

## Motivation

One of my colleagues at work had told me about this application he had built to lock messages for a certain amount of time.
I thought it was a really cool idea and wanted to build something similar. 
I had also been wanting to get more familiar with Thirdweb so this was a great opportunity to do so.
